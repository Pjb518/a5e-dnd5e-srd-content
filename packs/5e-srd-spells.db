This area is divorced from the magical energy that suffuses the multiverse. Within the sphere, spells can't be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and even magic items become mundane. Until the spell ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on you.</p><p>Spells and other magical effects, except those created by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere and can't protrude into it. A slot expended to cast a suppressed spell is consumed. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn't function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration.</p><p><strong>Targeted Effects.</strong> Spells and other magical effects, such as magic missile and charm person, that target a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on that target.</p><p><strong>Areas of Magic.</strong> The area of another spell or magical effect, such as fireball, can't extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed. For example, the flames created by a wall of fire are suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough.</p><p><strong>Spells.</strong> Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it.</p><p><strong>Magic Items.</strong> The properties and powers of magic items are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a +1 longsword in the sphere functions as a nonmagical longsword.</p><p>A magic weapon's properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a magic weapon or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere (for example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic spear at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.</p><p><strong>Magical Travel.</strong> Teleportation and planar travel fail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point for such magical travel. A portal to another location, world, or plane of existence, as well as an opening to an extradimensional space such as that created by the rope trick spell, temporarily closes while in the sphere.</p><p><strong>Creatures and Objects.</strong> A creature or object summoned or created by magic temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer within the sphere.</p><p><strong>Dispel Magic.</strong> Spells and magical effects such as dispel magic have no effect on the sphere.

The target is entombed far beneath the earth in a Sphere of magical force that is just large enough to contain the target. Nothing can pass through the sphere, nor can any creature Teleport or use Planar Travel to get into or out of it. The special component for this version of the spell is a small mithral orb.</p><p><strong>Chaining</strong>. Heavy chains, firmly rooted in the ground, hold the target in place. The target is Restrained until the spell ends, and it can't move or be moved by any means until then. The special component for this version of the spell is a fine chain of precious metal.</p><p><strong>Hedged Prison</strong>. The spell transports the target into a tiny Demiplane that is warded against teleportation and Planar Travel. The Demiplane can be a labyrinth, a cage, a tower, or any similar confined structure or area of your choice. The special component for this version of the spell is a miniature representation of the prison made from jade.</p><p><strong>Minimus Containment</strong>. The target shrinks to a height of 1 inch and is imprisoned inside a gemstone or similar object. Light can pass through the gemstone normally (allowing the target to see out and other creatures to see in), but nothing else can pass through, even by means of teleportation or Planar Travel. The gemstone can't be cut or broken while the spell remains in effect. The special component for this version of the spell is a large, transparent gemstone, such as a corundum, diamond, or ruby.</p><p><strong>Slumber</strong>. The target falls asleep and can't be awoken. The special component for this version of the spell consists of rare soporific herbs.</p><p><strong>Ending the Spell</strong>. During the casting of the spell, in any of its versions, you can specify a condition that will cause the spell to end and release the target. The condition can be as specific or as elaborate as you choose, but the DM must agree that the condition is reasonable and has a likelihood of coming to pass. The Conditions can be based on a creature's name, identity, or deity but otherwise must be based on observable Actions or qualities and not based on intangibles such as level, class, or Hit Points.</p><p>A Dispel Magic spell can end the spell only if it is cast as a 9th-level spell, targeting either the prison or the special component used to create it.</p><p>You can use a particular special component to create only one prison at a time.

You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.</p><p><strong>Similar Area</strong>. You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.</p><p><strong>Mishap</strong>. The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).</p>","favorite":false,"secretDescription":"","source":"","uses":{"value":null,"max":0,"per":""},"components":{"vocalized":true,"seen":false,"material":false},"concentration":false,"level":7,"materials":"","materialsConsumed":false,"prepared":false,"ritual":false,"schools":{"primary":"conjuration","secondary":[]}},"effects":[],"flags":{},"_stats":{"systemId":"a5e","systemVersion":"0.9.8","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1679946861458,"modifiedTime":1679947067585,"lastModifiedBy":"xOfpHHT4gMWcJ9vi"},"_id":"h3nq1Sg0asOkUh8b","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"xOfpHHT4gMWcJ9vi":3}}
